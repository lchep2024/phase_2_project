# Real Estate Revelations: The Power of Predictive Modeling
## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of real estate, every smart upgrade can make or break a sale. Now, imagine if you had a tool that could tell you exactly which home renovations would boost property values the most. 

Picture this: a real estate agent, with the help of advanced data analytics, effortlessly identifying the best improvements for any home, ensuring every dollar spent translates into a significant increase in value. 

Welcome to our real estate valuation project, where we combine the power of modern statistics with the practical needs of home renovation. Using state-of-the-art linear regression models, we uncover the hidden gems in the data, guiding you through the maze of property enhancements to find the most profitable path. 

Join us on this journey to turn guesswork into strategy and potential into profit, making homes not just beautiful places to live, but smart investments for the future.

## Problem Statement
Determining which home renovations will most effectively increase property values is a significant challenge for real estate agencies, homeowners, and property investors. 

Without precise, data-driven guidance, resources are often allocated to improvements that yield suboptimal returns, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for maximizing property values. 

This project aims to address this problem by leveraging advanced linear regression models to identify key features and renovations that significantly impact home values. By providing clear, actionable insights, the project seeks to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the market value of properties.
## Objectives

### 1. Data cleaning and preparation.

To Obtain a dataset that contains relevant information, clean the data and prepare it for modeling

### 2. Feature Selection and Modelling

To determine the features in the dataset that are most predictive and use them to build linear regression models.

### 3. Model evaluation and validation

To use metrics to evaluate and validate the linear regression model built.

### 4. Provide Recommendations

To use the insights from the data and the models to offer actionable insights.
## Data Understanding
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which is available in the file `kc_house_data`.csv. 

The dataset includes comprehensive information on house sales in King County, providing valuable insights into various attributes that influence property values.

This dataset is highly suitable for addressing the problem of identifying key home renovations that increase property values. This is because it has a wide range of features that are crucial in analysing house value.
### Description of columns
The dataset contains 21 columns and 21,597 rows.

Now to go into more detail on the columns we have. We will use the `column_names.md` file to get more information about our columns.
* `id` - Unique identifier for a house
* `date` - Date house was sold
* `price` - Sale price (prediction target)
* `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
* `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
* `sqft_living` - Square footage of living space in the home
* `sqft_lot` - Square footage of the lot
* `floors` - Number of floors (levels) in house
* `waterfront` - Whether the house is on a waterfront
* `view` - Quality of view from house. An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was.
* `condition` - How good the overall condition of the house is. Related to maintenance of house. An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the house.
* `grade` - Overall grade of the house. Related to the construction and design of the house, where 1-3 is poor, 4-6 is low average, 7 is average, 8-9 is good, and 10-13 is excellent.
* `sqft_above` - Square footage of house apart from basement
* `sqft_basement` - Square footage of the basement
* `yr_built` - Year when house was built
* `yr_renovated` - Year when house was renovated
* `zipcode` - ZIP Code used by the United States Postal Service
* `lat` - Latitude coordinate
* `long` - Longitude coordinate
* `sqft_living15` - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
* `sqft_lot15` - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
